<span class="mainarticle">Phone connector, a.k.a. headphone jack was invented and used since 19th century. Which means, everyone is used to its wide connectivity, and convinence.
<br>Now, Apple starts to disagree that headphone jack is not a best option to listen at music, they are actually removing headphone jacks from iPhones.
<br>There should be a reason of doing this. In fact, Apple had a several reasons on this decision. 
<br><Br><span class="buyorno">Waterproof.</span>
<br><br>Starting iPhone 7, Apple made a waterproof a standard feature for their iPhone lineups. <br>Still, this was a bit late since Sony announced their world-first waterproof phone in early 2013, Xperia Z; 
<br>and Samsung started to put waterproof as a standard feature since Galaxy S7.

<br><br>In order to "waterproof" the phone, every single ports and holes should be sealed with a special liquid. However, this "special sealing liquid" costs a bit,
<br>and the manufactors have to rise the price. But, they know that if they increase the price, angry customers will negatively affect their phones.
<br>That is the only reason they decided to take off the earphone jack: to make them easier to waterproof the phone.
<br><br>Apple added Wireless Charging feature on iPhone 8 and X. Maybe someday, who knows, they might take off the charging port!
